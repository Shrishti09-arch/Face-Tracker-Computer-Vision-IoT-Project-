Face Tracker 🎯

📌 Project Overview

The Face Tracker is a real-time computer vision and IoT-based project that detects and tracks human faces using a webcam and automatically follows the face movement using servo motors. The system combines Python-based face detection with Arduino-controlled pan and tilt mechanisms to achieve smooth and responsive tracking.

<br/>
🛠️ Technologies Used


Python

OpenCV

CVZone

Arduino Uno

Servo Motors

PyFirmata

Computer Vision

IoT

<br/>
⚙️ How It Works


The webcam captures live video input.

OpenCV and CVZone detect the face in each frame.

The face position is calculated relative to the frame center.

Python sends position data to Arduino using PyFirmata.

Servo motors adjust their angles to keep the face centered using pan and tilt movement.
